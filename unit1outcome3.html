<h4>Unit 1, 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>Could i have been more efficient?.<br>
    Yes i could have had a clear vision of what i wanted rather than just throw mysef at the project and try different things, however in doing this i was able to see that my skills dont quite match my creative imagination yet and that is what i will be working on in the next few months.<br>
    Productivity!, my work ethics and self motivation have kept me on task since assignment start and i have worked in my own time to add extra content and features that i really wanted to learn and understand.
    <br>if this question was around productivity on the project then as it was a solo project coceptualised and implemented by myself then no, but a group effort would be quite different, you would want to have it managed differently, this may include regular meetings, setting deadlines on certain tasks and having brainstorm sessions when coming up with creative content.

<h4>Unit 1, 3.2 Describe was to increase efficiency and productivity.</h4>
    <div class="text">
        <p>To simply improve productivity, i am a keen advocate of trust and freedom, i have managed teams in various fields and i would my staff were most productive when given and element of freedom, i am aware that this is not always possible but in the digital media environment you have to be allowed to "break out" if you are hitting a wall or becoming stck with an issue, them often if it a good idea to take a short break and get off subject so that you brain can allow itself to not subconciously become fixated on the problem.<br>
            By moving away and then revisiting i have personally found the answer was so obvious but out of reach because i was only looking at the immidiate problem not a way of resolving it.<br>
            If i had been asked to work on a team prohect thenn i would have increased my productivity by allowing myself to observe an understand another persons approach to the task so that i may be inspired or even counter the idea with a suggestion that may move the proccess forward.<br>
            To increase efficiency, i would mirror the above but ensure that you set objectives or targest by set times but allow open diary time to have people approach others with ideas or evrn to just bounce them off one another.<br>
            Efficiency would also be covered in the way the team or individual is working, are they doing something on a project that is on open source so use, or is their a program that can create an element for you rather than have to creat it yourself from scratch?.<br>
            Do they have the correct tools to be efficiant?
        </p>

<h4>Unit 1, 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in a digital project.</h4>
    <div class="text">
        <p><a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">Eat That Frog [9]</a> a time management book by Brian Tracey based on Mark Twains quote <br>
            <q>If the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.</q><br>
            <br>
            Since i found and read this book i have done most of my days in this manner, what it means is that do your biggest challenge first thing in the morning adn the rest of the day should go much smoother, in terms of produtivity i owul itterate thsoi as whatever is an issue in the project you should takle that first then everything else should fall into place or at least no be a big challenge.
            <br>
            If i were to undertake this solo project again i would not change the way i have worked as i have found that i have learnt more in the approach i have taken that being guided through the information slides that we were.<br>
            </p>

<h4>Unit 1, 3.4 Descrive how I would go about testing digital solutions.</h4>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Digital solutions in my opinion, is a method of testing both internal and external software, systems, ifrastructure, networks and digital security.<br>
            This could be to introduce new products and services, or to increase productivity by automating work that is currently done manually.<br>
            <br>
            To test my work i would do as i have done alreay by opening my site for feedback and review but make the audience much wider adn diverse. Have i considered users with a disability? Is the page accssessable to all. if not how can i be sure that all whio use it will have the same expierence or it even works at all.
