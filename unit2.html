<h4>Unit 2, 1.1 describe the content and layout for each page</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>I have chosen the same layout for each page on my project with the exception of the contact me page as i wanted to example some of the skills i have gained during my research and implemetation of those ideas.
        I have used a container called navBar, and inserted links to my other pages with contect on them, this is then pasted into every other page to allow the end user to easily navigate through my page using the expanding buttons at the head of the page.<br>
        I have set a universal background image to all of my pages of a high quality office environment available with no copyright protection to give a proffesional look to the page, the text content of my page is is its own class that i defined as "text", this has a classic light gray backing to the text that allows the users to see through at the back image overall leaving a clear page that can be read easily.<br><br>

<h4>Unit 2, 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints effecting websites</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>"Copyright" is the exclusive and assignable legal right, given to the originator for a fixed number of years, to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material.<br>
you might be infringing upon copyrighted work in you in anyway, distribute copies of the work to the public, perform, show or play the work in public.<br>
If you are found to be in direct breach of copyright law you could face a prison sentance and a fine or eather of these two seperately.<br>
</p>
</div>

<h4>Unit 2, 1.6 Describe access issues that need taking into account.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>I have considered the accessability of those that may use my website, i can imagine that individuals with visual impairments, would be the primary conern.<br>
        i have de-cluttered the page and make the contrast of the information set off against the background in gentle colours, with an east=y to understand font style and size.<br>
        i would consider ading a toggle switch for a Day/Night mode as this would be a useful addition to those that prefer a darker UI than the slighter brighter expierence i have made as the default for my pages.<br>
        </p>
</div>

<h4>Unit 2, 1.7 Describe the appropriate file types for websites.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>Whilst building a website you have access to many file types an the VSC/CSS facilities allow you to add and edit them into usable content for the HTML file.<br>
        I have added a .gif file type (the moving cat image in my navigation bar, i have added a .jpg file for my main background (the elegant office in the back)<br>
        Whilst searching for inspiration i have seen that you can ulso imber vidoes and .mp4 files if you wished to have a feature that plays a clip on your site, this would be perfect for an educational page that the video would show tutorials that could be sticky on scroll, whilst the user follows the directions in text on the page.<br>
        i have not seen a limitation to the files you can use in the programs i have so far and imaging ones my skill grows i will be able to add more usable content that enriches the expierence to the next level.<br>
