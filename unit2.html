<h4>Unit 2, 1.1 describe the content and layout for each page</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>I have chosen the same layout for each page on my project with the exception of the contact me page as i wanted to example some of the skills i have gained during my research and implemetation of those ideas.
        I have used a container called navBar, and inserted links to my other pages with contect on them, this is then pasted into every other page to allow the end user to easily navigate through my page using the expanding buttons at the head of the page.<br>
        I have set a universal background image to all of my pages of a high quality office environment available with no copyright protection to give a proffesional look to the page, the text content of my page is is its own class that i defined as "text", this has a classic light gray backing to the text that allows the users to see through at the back image overall leaving a clear page that can be read easily.<br><br>
