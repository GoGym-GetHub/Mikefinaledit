            <li>Unit 1.1 - The purpose of IT in modern business</li>
            <p>Personally, I feel that the purpose of modern IT in business in imperative to the immediate success of the business.
                <br>
                In an age of the “quick win” or “start up” era everyone and anyone can have a new idea with a 'USP' that has never been to market before and with the explosive potential of the newest trend business has never been more approachable for the masses.
                <br>
                The IT world itself has exploded if you look at technology in the time we have been using the medium itself, from the evolution of the concept and the modern computer in the early 19th century and 1936 respectively by<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/" target="_blank">Charles Babbage</a>&<a href="https://www.bl.uk/people/alan-turing/" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>. to the current leading tech experts like<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/" target="_blank">Apple</a>we have seen it evolve quicker and wider than any other advancement in recorded history.
                <br>
                It can be used to simply track and prove work to the ability to be completely digital and advance each and every time someone moves with an idea.
