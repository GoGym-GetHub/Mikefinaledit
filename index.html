            <h4>ABOUT ME AND MY JOURNEY!</h4>
            <div class="text">
                        <p>So you found my page!<br>
                        Allow me to introduce myself and what has led me here, I am a 33 year old man, coming from a distinguished background in management achieving at senior levels of multiple disciplined fields.                                 <br>          
                        As many will attest to it can and will likely be frustrating moving into a business with an already established system or process, as a fluid personality i am always looking to improve anything by living my life to “LEAN” principles, I try to cut waste from life and processes, even in everyday life we as humans complete so many unnecessary actions due to habit or social conformity.<br>
                        <br>
                        Think about your everyday life, or maybe how you have accessed this page, you will have already forgot the steps you took to get to where you are on the internet reading this, if you are on a mobile device then its likely that, someone has simplified the logging in process by allowing you to use a fingerprint to securely log you on instead of the common digitised or password process, this small idea from some bright spark has sped up and simplified how we access devices in a time where data and instant access is seemingly becoming one of our most valuable commodities.<br>                                    
                        I came to code nation following my decision to leave management as I was not excited about where I was going in my life and what I would be doing in 10 years.<br>
                        Did I really want to be looking after staff who did not actually have an interest in the work they were being paid to complete ?<br> So I had a choice….. do something that I can work on that will stand me good for the future, something that will allow me to stand back and say "I did that!" <br>
                        Although I have enjoyed many aspects of managing teams and processes, my personal successes in those roles have left me. I say this because once i have trained and equipped potential future leaders with the skills they needed, it inevitably led to them needing to leave their current position and go out into the world alone to find their own path which came as a bitter success to me. <br>
                        It gave me genuine pride knowing that I had enabled them to get where they are going but this was often the end of the story with that individual in a proffesional manner.<br>

            <h3>My future in coding</h3>
            <div class="text">
                        <p>Becoming a Developer to me means that I can be a catalyst for change and bring ideas to life in an age where it is ok to get it wrong, many people in my life and myself at some points have been afraid to change something through fear of making a mistake, my own journey to coding has been an example of this. 
                        <br>
                        Moving forward with the times and the tech industry has me excited for the first time in a while for many reasons and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me. i have no idea of the possibilities available to me yet or the potential companies awaiting eager staff, i am in control of where i want to go to the best extent of the statement.
                        <br>
