<h4>Unit 1, 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>I have been becoming more familiar using the tools available to myself during this course and what i have been able to source form the internet.<br>
        My approach to the project has not changed although i would say that i have not utalised the TRELLO board as much as i had expected myself to need it, i think that is mainly because of the freedon i have allowed myself in creating this website.<br><br>
        I have been able to memorise or near immisiately access what i wanted and implemented it almost as quick with a small fine tuning here and there.
        The more i use the provided laptop the more i miss my own equipment however this is a preference as the equipment is definately up to the task at hand.<br><br>
        The more i use CSS and VSC i am seeing that even without any "Plug-ins" or "Extensions", that it is an impresive peice of sowtware and the more my skills grow the more i see myself being able to create stunning and intuitive end products for the clients i may have.<br>
        Am i happy with my site ?<br>In short yes, with my current skill, i beleive i have created an interesting if not slightly proffesional page that demonstartes my understanding of the work that was asked of me as a student.
    </p>

<h4>Unit 1, 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>During my course at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com" target="_blank">CODENATION</a> i have been been directed to use these tools, however i beleive that they are currently the most popular in the market as codenation prides itself having "More than 90% of our graduates have secured a job in tech as a result of studying with Code Nation."<br><br>
        The course materials that are used are to a great standard and from what i can make out continually developed by the team to ensure that each ned class hsa relevant and correct information to enable the to learn at the pace the need to to stay on track with the progression of the course.<br>
        GitHub for me is the best tool i have access to, i have caused some "pain" with the tutors as i wanted to learn more and more and was completing the work at home too, this proved difficult at first as my understanding of them was not there but once i learnt i was able to work in the class environment then jump on in the evening and tweak or get ahead as needed.<br>
        the ability to download and then re-upload my work was easy once understood as super conveinient.

<h4>Unit 1, 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of my final project!</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>Its Perfect!!<br>
        <br>
        No, it isn't don't worry, i am aware that people can sometimes find it difficult to see the flaws in work they have done themselves, but i thiink that you cannot work 100% if you are guarded over something that may just be improvable by someone else's input.<br>
        i feel that i can obkectively step back and assess my own work well, i am definately aware of some of the flaws in my own choices.<br>
        <br>
        Strengths:-      Clear, Flowing, Simple, Aesthetically Pleasing, it has Nyan cat!.<br>
        Weaknesses:-      Bright, Simple, Boring, Single input, no USP.<br><br>
        With the above, i would not remove this as it will give me a reflection point so hopefully i can look back one day and see how far i have come on my journey (or not).
    </p>

<h4>Unit 1, 2.4 Describe further improvements</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>To be asked this question now is a starnge one for me as i would make the effort to add what i could in the time given, although if i had longer i would definately research more CSS skills so that i can manipulate the scren better and make everything more presentable.<br>
        I could introduce a "hamburger" menu as that was something i wished to add however i found it quite challenging, i would look to make this knowledge part of my repetour in the coming weeks even if that means completing further mock site sin my free tome.
        <br>
        Further improvements could also be checking that all items are perfectly aligned and that i have thouroiughly tested everything from every angle.
        Generic improvements could be made once the site is live so i have no major concerns over the site at present.

<h4>Unit 1, 2.5 Review outcomes</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>In review of the outcomes i will summarise below<br><br>
        Unit 1 Outcome 1<br>
        I was given a role of Technical Consultant, i had to plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs.<br><br>
        I think i have acheived this goal and this site is the evidence of this.<br><br>
        Unit 1 Outcome 2<br>
        I had to review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful.<br>
