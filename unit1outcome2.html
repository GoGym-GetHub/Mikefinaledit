            Unit 2.1 review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.
(in making my own site am I happy? Why?
During the two weeks I have been completing “coding” and creating website content, I have become ofee with the Mac operating systems however I would prefer to work on my native Windows format, I am aware of the supposed limitations to the later of the two given however this is usually based on an over the counter comparison, and when building PC’s you see the huge advantage on using a windows OS.<br>
In terms of the resoues available for everything else I h=am happy considering t=my current level of education but this may naturally evolve over time and with familiarity.<br>
GitHub desktop is very handy but I have found some difficulties with the pulling of files the following day, however I am the detractor in this as it is probably user error and not of the design.

Unit 2.2 describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.
During the course with CodeNation (link it) I was given the base resources and left to evolve my own skills and knowledge, I have still used the sources given however utilised google and other medias to learn more and gains skill.


Unit 2.3 asses the strengths and waeknesses on=f my final project, Why, what would I change and look objectively. (talk about not deleting it and looking back in 6-9mths)

Unit 2.4 describe further improvements.
(how could I improve my project?)
