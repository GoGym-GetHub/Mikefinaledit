<h4>Unit 1, 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>As i have been becoming more familiar using the tools available to myself during this course and what i have been able to source form the internet.<br>
        My approach to the project has not changed although i would say that i have not utalised the TRELLO board as much as i had expected myself to need it, i think that is mainly because of the freedon i have allowed myself in creating this website.<br><br>
        I have been able to memorise or near immidiately access what i wanted and implemented it almost as quick with a small fine tuning here and there.
        The more i use the provided laptop the more i miss my own equipment however this is a preference as the equipment is cabable of performing the actions i has been provided to do.<br><br>
        The more i use CSS and VSC i am seeing that even without any "Plug-ins" or "Extensions", that it is an impresive peice of sowtware and the more my skills grow the more i see myself being able to create stunning and intuitive end products for the clients i may have.<br>
        Am i happy with my site ?<br>In short yes, with my current skill, i beleive i have created an interesting if not slightly proffesional page that demonstartes my understanding of the work that was asked of me as a student.
        GitHub desktop is very handy but I have found some difficulties with the pulling of files the following day, however I am the probable detractor in this as it is likely user error and not of the design.
    </p>

<h4>Unit 1, 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>During my course at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com" target="_blank">CODENATION</a> i have been been directed to use these tools, however i beleive that they are currently the most popular in the market as codenation prides itself having "More than 90% of our graduates have secured a job in tech as a result of studying with Code Nation."<br><br>
        The course materials that are used are to a great standard and from what i can make out continually developed by the team to ensure that each ned class hsa relevant and correct information to enable the to learn at the pace the need to to stay on track with the progression of the course.<br>
        GitHub for me is the best tool i have access to, i have caused some "pain" with the tutors as i wanted to learn more and more and was completing the work at home too, this proved difficult at first as my understanding of them was not there but once i learnt i was able to work in the class environment then jump on in the evening and tweak or get ahead as needed.<br>
        the ability to download and then re-upload my work was easy once understood and super conveinient.

<h4>Unit 1, 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of my final project!</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>Its Perfect!!<br>
        <br>
        No, it isn't don't worry, i am aware that people can sometimes find it difficult to see the flaws in work they have done themselves, but i thiink that you cannot work 100% if you are guarded over something that may just be improvable by someone else's input.<br>
        I feel that i can objectively step back and assess my own work well, i am definately aware of some of the flaws in my own choices.<br>
        I have also asked close friends for direct feedback on the site layout, content and overall image.<br> Being friends i was not expecting serious responses however i managed to take some insight from their "kind words", and used that information to alter sections before i was happy with the design.
        <br>
        Strengths:-      Clear, Flowing, Simple, Aesthetically Pleasing, it has Nyan cat!.<br>
        Weaknesses:-      Bright, Simple, Boring, Single input, no USP.<br><br>
        With the above, i would not remove this site from my memories, as it will give me a reflection point so hopefully i can look back one day and see how far i have come on my journey (or not).

<h4>Unit 1, 2.4 Describe further improvements</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>To be asked this question now is a starnge one for me as i have added the content you can see and made great efforts to grow and produce more features in the limited time i have been given, if i were to restart this project with my current skill and understanding i would definately research more CSS skills so that i can manipulate the screen and content better to make it more presentable.<br>
        I could introduce a "hamburger" menu as that was something i wished to add however i found it quite challenging, i would look to make this knowledge part of my repetour in the coming weeks even if that means creating further mock sites on GitHub in my free time.
        <br>
        Further improvements could also be checking that all items are perfectly aligned and that i have thouroughly tested everything from every angle.
        Generic improvements could be made once the site is live so i have no major concerns over the site at present.

<h4>Unit 1, 2.5 Review outcomes</h4>
<div class="text">
    <p>In review of the outcomes i will summarise below<br><br>
        Unit 1 Outcome 1<br>
        I was given the assignment of having a role of Technical Consultant, i had to plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs.<br><br>
        For this i had no client or aim in mind and with no limitations on the content i could produce, i had decided to create a simple project with a few elegant features that might set me above my peers in the class, i have completed this by adding a NavBar with advanced features whilst being confident i could look at the code and piece it together rather than not being able to explain if questioned.<br>
        I have also utalised a code that allows for flip card in my contact me section so that the user has an interactive element to their expierence whilst viewing the page.<br>
        I have demonstrated the ability to show text clearly and uss CSS to define it into differing sections accross the pages i have displayed. 
        I think i have acheived this goal and this site is the evidence of this.<br><br>
        
        Unit 1 Outcome 2<br>
        I had to review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful.<br>

        I have during my time on the project, constantly reviewed my use of the tools available. And i have elaborated above that i found myself not needing to rely on something i imagined that i would have needed to (TRELLO).<br>
        I became aware that the systems would not really effect my project as i had viewed it on the most common web browsers available at the time with very little to no difference in performance or style accross them all.
        From start to finish of my project i have not introduced any new software or programs but became informed through the use of Google that the internet has a near endless base of properties that i can add or use to tweak my current and future work.
