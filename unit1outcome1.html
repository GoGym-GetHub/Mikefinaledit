            <h3>Improving productivity with IT</h3>
    <h4>Unit 1, 1.1 - The purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
    <div class="text">
            <p>     Personally, I feel that the purpose of modern IT in business in imperative to the immediate success of the business.
                    <br>
                    In an age of the “quick win” or “start up” era everyone and anyone can have a new idea with a 'USP' that has never been to market before and with the explosive potential of the newest trend business has never been more approachable for the masses.
                    <br>
                    The IT world itself has exploded if you look at technology in the time we have been using the medium itself, from the evolution of the concept and the modern computer in the early 19th century and 1936 respectively by<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/" target="_blank"> Charles Babbage</a> &<a href="https://www.bl.uk/people/alan-turing/" target="_blank"> Alan Turing</a>. to the current leading tech experts like<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/" target="_blank"> Apple</a> we have seen it evolve quicker and wider than any other advancement in recorded history.
                    <br>
                    It can be used to simply track and prove work to the ability to be completely digital and advance each and every time someone moves with an idea.
            </p>
    </div>
<h4>Unit 1, 1.2 - What Methods, Skills & Resources are needed to complete projects?</h4>
    <div class="text">
            <p>To make projects successful you need an end goal….
                    <br>You will need to understand what the client wants and from what background they are in so that you can ensure that your project is going to start on the correct track before you even get started.
                    <br>
                    A clear plan and some foundations from what they are as a business including their core values will help, a clear and open proccess with regular "chek-ins" will be a great advantage as you can alter or update you plans as you go remaining AGILE.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Skills, are to simply listen, but also understand what they are trying to acheive in the pr0ject and no take what they say vebatim, I could say 100 words and not actually cover the idea I have!.
                    <br>
                    Another valuable skill for me is the ability to objectively look at your own work and see that it can be improved, is it functional (does it work), is it easy to use (does it work because you made it or because its layed out really well?)                        <br>
                    Is there any opportunity to develop further or add any additional features that you were not aware of at initial concept, or have you asked someone else to check it and see if you have missed or overlook anything.
                 </p>
    </div>
<h4>Unit 1, 1.3 - How will you plan and carry out your project?</h4>
    <div class="text">
            <p>As a person whom i would say stays relatively up to date with the latest trends and information, i would expect to use what is avilable to me at the time of undertaking a project or task.
                    <br>
                    However i would say what is certainely needed for any project is a good planning tool such as those available for free by companies such as<a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank"> TRELLO</a> this is a site that allows you to create very easy to manage boards based on the "KAN-BAN" principle.<br> Many other programs like these are availble to use and you have the ability to open them up to the public to help get or share ideas on how you have managed a project or big life event such as a wedding or preparing for the arrival of a child.
                    <br>
                    I personally have enjoyed TRELLO as it was very simple to get started through the use of the built in tutorial. Once loaded in i was able to assign "cards" for each of my created sections and then move them along the journey to completion once i had done what i needed, i am a quite methodical person however as many are when faced with an abundance of information its is usually better to plan out and organise what you have so that you can see a way forward.</p>
                </div>
<h4>Unit 1, 1.4 - What are the risks to digital projects ?</h4>
    <div class="text">
                <p>Aside from physical issues as Network failure or a system issues i would state the greatest risk to a digital project is the lack of vision and willingness for others to see a different side of something.<br>
                If i were to sit down now and start working on a piece of work that was not alligned to what the rest of the team were doing or expecting of me i have not only wasted my own time but potentially caused greater issues if it were close to deadline or up for review by the client, for this i would suggest that a plan or roles are created prior to started the work.
                <br>
                Get an understanding of what the client is trying to acheive through your work and you will have a better grasp of what creativity you can add to the project.
                </p>
        </div>
<h4>Unit 1, 1.5 - How do i know i have chosen the correct systems and programs?</h4>
    <div class="text">
            <p>Ultimately i guess there is no correct system, if the client gets the product they asked for you have done what was needed. I would expect this to be a point of discussion at the planning stage, but if the tools you have are easily accessable to all involved, relaible and at an effective cost/return to you then they are going to be ok for the project.<br>
                if you are in a business with a set skill base such as being a music producer, they would have limited need for a "Photoshop" type program. I would also consider the limitations of programs as a lot of new companies are created because no program did what they needed and they possessed the drive to create software for the market.
                </p>
            </div>
<h4>Unit 1, 1.6 - How have the technologies i have chosen helped me ?</h4>
    <div class="text">
            <p>The technologies i have chosen for this project are based on my current limited knowledge and what i have learnt from self learning in the 2 weeks i have been coding and using HTML5.
                    <br>
                    TRELLO has been a key asset for me, i have been able to very quickly nip onto my personal board and add points that have popped into my head or even when i have been off task i have had a thought that may be a good quality to the project i am working upon.
                    i have just added a "card" with the information and then when im back working on it i will not have lost that thought or idea that could be a great addition or just another item to discard but if i didnt add it i would have forgotton it.
                    <br>
                    There are many prorams that allow you to quickly jot or recall information but with TRELLO, i am already actively using and moving the "cards" around updating my progress and reviewing steps i classed as completed if the new addition could improve it.
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> GIT-HUB</a> is an amazing resource in my opinion, not only does it act as a storage centre for our files and repositories, but GitHub is an open source version ontrol system giving users the ability to store the most recent version of any code that they have been working upon and allowing other users to download and check or contribute towards.
                    <br>
                    GitHub also performs as a community for people to give and receive advice on codes and issues that they have been facing, to compliment this feature, they have a contribution section of your profile which traks what you have uploaded allowing for self reflection and monitoring your own performance to some extent.
                    I thing GitHub could be improved through the use of a medal/points system, that users give to members for their contributions and help similar to other websites.
                    </p>
            </div>
<h4>Unit 1, 1.7 - What legal constraints are their that could effect your project?</h4>
            <div class="text">
                    <p>Digital projects are to comply with all (GDPR) regulations from 25th May 2018. meaning that a you must abide by the framework for data protection laws.
                            <br>
                            <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018" target="_blank">Summary to GDPR</a> follow the link to see Wired.co.uk summary of GDPR compliance.
                        People creating digital media aslo have access to the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/dmlp" target="_blank">DMLP</a> this is a database of over 900 entries that overs lawsuits, subpoenas and other legal actions that involve digital media and online speech.
                        <br>
                        These are shown in plain-language descriptions, and contain the threat classification, link to the source and press coverage of the incident. you also have a search function with over 25 distinct data fields, so if you have any conerns you can search for a logged contravention before undertaking any work.
